### Osrank Specification

This document contains the specifications for the current and future
implementation of the [osrank algorithm](https://github.com/oscoin/osrank-rs).

As the algorithm is evolving, the document needs to do the same, so it might happen that they are out of sync at times.

Also see the [oscoin white paper](http://oscoin.io/oscoin.pdf) for the initial ideas for osrank.
